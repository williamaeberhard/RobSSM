RobSSM: R Code for Robust Estimation for State Space Models
-----------------------------------------------------------

These separate R files provide functions to simulate data according to the North Sea pollock stock assessment state space model (SSM) and fit the model according to (Laplace-approximated) maximum likelihood (ML) and robust estimation methods. The RobSSM_Main.r script guides through all functions and generates plots similar to those in the paper. Estimation relies on the R package Template Model Builder (TMB). Details about the robust methodology and theoretical properties can be found in Aeberhard et al. (2018).
