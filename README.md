RobSSM: R Code for Robust Estimation of State Space Models
----------------------------------------------------------

These separate R scripts provide functions to simulate data according to the North Sea pollock stock assessment state space model (SSM) and fit the model according to (Laplace-approximated) maximum likelihood and robust (bounded influence) estimation methods. Estimation relies on the R package Template Model Builder (TMB). Details about the methodology and theoretical properties can be found in Aeberhard et al. (2018).
